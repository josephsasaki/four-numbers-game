# four-numbers-game

For my Capstone Project, I have created the "Four Numbers Game" as a python, in-terminal game! The aim of the game is to calculate the number **24** using four provided numbers; try and solve as many puzzles as possible in the allotted time!

In order to play the game, download the repository files in a python virtual envirnoment in which the python library `rich` is installed. Next, run the python script and play in the terminal!
